# A Curated List of Awesome AI Newsletters

A one‚Äêstop GitHub repository of the very best AI newsletters‚Äîhandpicked to help you implement small, daily improvements that compound into massive productivity gains.

Here‚Äôs the thing most people miss:  
> **AI isn‚Äôt about keeping up with every new model.**  
> It‚Äôs about finding small, **practical** ways to improve your workflow _every single day_.  

üëâ If you could boost your productivity by just 1% each day, the magic of compounding means you‚Äôd be nearly **3,778%** more productive after one year‚Äîbecause small improvements multiply.

This obsession with actionable, implementable tips drove me to subscribe to dozens of AI newsletters.
